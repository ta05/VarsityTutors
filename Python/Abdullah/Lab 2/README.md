# Lab 2

## Task

Write a Python program that will determine food costs for the KSU CCSE hackathon. The hackathon will have pizza and salad options. The program should as the number of people who ordered pizza and the number of people who ordered a salad. Each salad costs $7.99 per persion. The pizza has 12 slices per pizza. Each person ordering pizza will be allotted three (3) slices of pizza. The cost of the pizza is $15.99 (only whole pizzas can be ordered).

If more than 10 (10) pizzas are ordered, then there will be a 15% discount. If more than 10 salads are ordered, there will be a 15% discount. The delivery charge is 7% pf the entire order prior to discounts or $20 minimum.

Display the number of each meals ordered (input is not considered display/output). Determin and display the number of pizzas needed. Display the cost of the pizzas and display the cost of salads (before any discounts). Display the discount amount and delivery charge. Finally display the total amount due.

Run the program 3 times and include three screenshots of the output -- once with no discounts, once with a pizza or salad discount and finally one that will have discounts for pizza and salad.
