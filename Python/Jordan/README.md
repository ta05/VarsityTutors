## Clothing Store

You're at a store to purchase any number of shirts, pants and hats. Shirts are normally $10, but are on sale for 20% off. Pants are full-priced at $20. Hats are priced at $5, but they have a buy-one-get-one-free offer. Write a function for the `cost_shirts` of num_shirts, for `cost_pants` of num_pants, and for `cost_hats` of num_hats. Then in the main method, prompt the user to enter the number of shirts, pants and hats they would like to purchase and calculate and display the cumulative final price for the number of each item they bought.

### Input

- Enter the number of shirts: 2
- Enter the number of pants: 1
- Enter the number of hats: 5

### Output

- The final price of 2 shirts, 1 pants and 5 hats is $51.00.



## Phone Number

Request the user to input a 10 digit number, and print the number in `(###) ###-####` form. Do this by writing three functions, a `get_prefix` function to return the prefix (4th through 6th digits) of the number, a `get_area_code` function to return the first 3 digits of the number, and a `get_line_number` function to return the line number (the final 4 digits), and calling the functions in the main method to correctly display the number in phone syntax form.

Example

The following program reads 10 digits as a phone number

For example if the user enters: 8772692967, then the output will be:  (877) 269-2967

- Input: Please enter 10 digits: 5457189635
- Output: Here is your formatted phone number: (545) 718-9635
