# Ball

Create a class called `Ball` that has two attributes, radius and color.

The class should have the following methods:

- `circumference`: returns the circumference of the object
- `surface`: returns the surface of the object
- `volume`: returns the volume of the object
- `paint`: accepts a parameter and changes the color of the object.

Write a program that will ask the user for radius and color.

The program should allow the user to create more than one ball.

Program should allow the user to display the circumference, surface, volume and color of all the objects when requested and the number of the objects.

Test your program with different attributes.
