# Balance Tree

## Primer

In computer science, a binary search tree (BST), also called an ordered or sorted binary tree, is a rooted binary tree whose internal nodes each store a key greater than all the keys in the node's left subtree and less than those in its right subtree.

A balanced tree is any node-based binary search tree that automatically keeps its height (maximal number of levels below the root) small in the face of arbitrary item insertions and deletions. The height of any node should be no more or less than 1 of the height of all other nodes.

## Task

Write a program takes in a valid BST and returns a balanced BST.
