# Random Numbers

## Task 1

Given integer variables `seedVal` and `highestInput`, generate five random numbers that are less than `highestInput` and greater than or equal to 0. Each number generated is output. Lastly, the average of the five numbers is output.

## Task 2

Given integer variables `seedVal`, `lowestVal` and `highestVal`, generate a lottery ticket number between `lowestVal` and `highestVal`.

## Task 3

Given integer variables `seedVal` and `largestNum`, seed the pseudorandom number generator with `seedVal`. Then, generate three random numbers in the range 1 to `largestNum` and output an equation of the form "A * B + C = X", where `A`, `B`, and `C` are the randomly generated numbers, and `X` is the solution to the equation. End with newline

### Example

If `largestNum` is `12`, then a possible output is:

~~~
7 * 11 + 6 = 83
~~~
