# Problem 17

## Description

Write a program that asks the user for words until the user enters a blank line, which is a return with no input (i.e. the empty string). Then the program should print out the longest and the shortest words entered. Use the appropriate loop. Create any variables that you need. No error checking is required (for the user putting two or more words on a line or other weirdness).

## Sample Output

~~~
Enter a word (blank to stop): farm
Enter a word (blank to stop): houses
Enter a word (blank to stop): zip
Enter a word (blank to stop): ridiculous
Enter a word (blank to stop): antidisestablishment
Enter a word (blank to stop): were
Enter a word (blank to stop):
The longest word was antidisestablishment and the smallest word was zip
