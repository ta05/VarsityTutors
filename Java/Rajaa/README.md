# Savings Account

Each object of the class contains private instance variables `accountNumber` indicating the unique account identifier number, `balance` indicating the amount the saver currently has on deposit, `firstName` indicating the account holder's first name, and `lastName` indicating the account holder's last name. Provide method `addInterest` to calculate the interest and adding it to the account balance. Provide methods to `withdraw` amounts from and `deposit` amounts to the account.
