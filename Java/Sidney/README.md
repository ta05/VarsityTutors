# Selection & Insertion Sort Programming Tasks

1. Write a new java class with a constructor.
2. Call a method from the constructor that will fill an ArrayList called **original** with 50 numbers between 1 and 100.
3. Store all the values from the original ArrayList in a second ArrayList called **temp**.
4. Call a method that will search the ArrayList using a **linear/sequential search** for the value 58 and return true if found and false if not. Display the number of steps necessary to complete the search.
5. Call a method that receives the unsorted ArrayList and sorts it using the **selection sort** technique. Make sure that tyou output the ArratList to see if it is truly sorted. Display the number of steps necessary to complete the sort.
6. Rebuild the original ArrayList by copying all values from temp back into **original**.
7. Call a method that receives the same unsorted ArrayList and sorts it using the **insertion sort** technique. Make sure that you output the ArrayList to see if it is truly sorted. Display the number of steps necessary to complete the sort.
8. Call a methos that will search the ArrayList using a **binary search** for the value of 58 and return if found and false if not. Display the number of steps necessary to complete the search.
