# Payroll

Write a program for the Payroll class.

The payroll class has a list of employee ids 

- {6668466, 4520125, 7895122, 8777541, 8451277, 1302850, 4447892}

Initialize an hours, a payrate and a wages array of length 7. Each element will match to the corresponding index of the employee id. Create the appropriate accessor and modifier methods. SetWages will take in the id, and will set the wages of the employee to the payrate * hours of the employee.

Create a driver to test the Payroll class.
