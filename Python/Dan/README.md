# Modulus 9

Generate a report that lists each individual word followed by the number of times it appears in the text. For example: `frequency_list = [('was', 3), ('bird', 5), ('it', 27)]` and so on. Note: Notice the structure - a list of tuples. If you're feeling daring, google how to sort this new list based on the second tuple value and see which word appears the most frequently.

Provide a list of word frequencies, incorporate error checking, command line input, and the templated format discussed during this module.
