# Tate

## Description

The program reads in artwork data from [rfordatascience](https://github.com/rfordatascience) and artist data from [tategallery](https://github.com/tategallery) into pandas dataframes and merges them.

The pre-written dimension function adds the dimension column to the merged dataframe based on the material medium of the artwork.

## Task

Write a program which plots the number of pieces by women to the total number of pieces based on the dimension by year to determine if trend exists of the ratio of artwork by women to total artwork over time.
