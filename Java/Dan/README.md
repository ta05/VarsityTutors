# Task

Type up a class in Java called **Combination** that has the following (note: all methods should be 'static')

- a `getFactorial` method that returns the factorial of a given integer (as a parameter). For instance, `getFactorial(5)` should return `120`, and `getFactorial(4)` should return `24`. Remember by definition, 0! = 1

- a `getCombination` method (that has two integer parameters) which uses the factorial method to return the combination of `n` items taken `r` at a time. For instance, `getCombination(5, 2)` should return `10` and `getCombination(7, 3)` should return `35`.

- a main method that will test both the `getFactorial` and `getCombination` methods, using input from the user. There should be appropriate output to verify that the methods work properly.
