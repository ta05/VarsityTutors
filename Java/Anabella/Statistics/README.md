## Statistics Task

Write a Statistics class that will generate an array of random numbers between 10 and 99. The Statistics class will also include a getMean method which will return the mean of the array, a getMode class which will return the mode of the array, and a sortList method which will be used in the getMode method and will sort the array in ascending order.

Then write a Tester/Driver to test your methods.

## ReadFile Task

Using the ReadFile class, read the rand.txt in the files folder into a String ArrayList. Then convert the list into an int array, so that we can use it to test the Statisitics methods.
