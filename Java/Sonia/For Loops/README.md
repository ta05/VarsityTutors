# For Loops

## Problem 1

Write a for loop that prints out all the numbers from 20-80 (inclusive) which have at least one digit which is a 3, in ascending order (i.e. smallest to largest).


## Problem 2

Write a for loop with 2 loop variables: one that goes from 1-20 (inclusive), and one that goes from 100-81 (inclusive). Within the loop, print out the product of the two variables, but only if it's divisible by 5. (For example, the first time through the loop, the variables would be 1 and 100, the product is 100, and it would print out this result. The second time through the loop, the variables would be 2 and 99, the product is 198, and it would not print it out).
