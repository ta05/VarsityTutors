# Homework 4

Wrote this starter code for a student which reads in data from a csv and reduces daily data into monthly data by creating a month dictionary and grouping the *day* columns by their first two characters, finding their corresponding month using the dictionary, and the data is aggregated using the mean.

Then we calculate the slope and y-intercept of the best-fit line for the two months we're checking (March and September). We use the best-fit attributes to calculate the anomalies, and, finally, the monthly data and their best-fit lines are plotted.
