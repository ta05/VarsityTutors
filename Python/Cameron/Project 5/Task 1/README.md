# Project 5 Task 1

## Task

Write a program which reads in a text from the keyboard until an excalamation mark ("!") is found. (Note that the exclamation mark might not be on the first line of input. It might be lines down). Count the number of occurrences of each letter A-Z (regardless of whether it is uppercase or lowercase). Count the total number of "other" characters.


Print out the count for each letter found (but not for those which were not found). Also, print the total count of the non-letter characters.


Print out the count of the number of vowels and the number of consonants.


Finally, print out which letter was found the most times. (Note: There may be more than one letter which has maximum count attached to it.) Also, print out which letter (or letters) was found the least number of times, but make certain to exclude letters which were not found at all.
