# Project 4: Problem Formulations

## Problem 3: NCAA Basketball Coach Winningness

We have a [dataset](https://github.com/ta05/VarsityTutors/blob/master/Python/Muhammad/NCAA%20Basketball/data/ncaa-team-data.csv) of season statistics for NCAA basketball teams (and their associated head coaches). We would like to know how the season winrates vary across coaches. We want a final dataset we can explore with this information (transfromed from the original dataset), and which 5 coaches have the best average winrates (across seasons), and which 5 coaches have the worst average winrates (across seasons). **NOTE**: the win percentage is not in the original dataset (only number of wins and losses), so you will have to compute this value.
