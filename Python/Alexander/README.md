# Count String


## Description  

You must create a program that has a `main()` function and a `count_string()` function that takes in a string. The goal is to ask the user for a string, and count how many uppercase and lowercase characters there are in the string.  

## Requirements  
- You must use at least `main()` and `count_string()` functions
- You **cannot** use `eval[]`
- You **cannot** use `isupper()` or `islower()`  

## Sample Output

The user input is in **bold**

### Example
`Hello! Please type in a string: `**`hEllo wORld`**  
`There are 3 uppercase and 7 lowercase characters in "hEllo wORld"`
