## Vowel Words

A **vowel word** is a word that contains every vowel. Some examples of vowel words are *sequioa*, *facetious*, and *dialogue*. Determine if a word input by the user is a vowel word.

## Bouncing Ball

The *coefficient of restitution* of a ball, a number between 0 and 1, specifies how much energy is conserved when the ball hits a rigid surface. A coefficient of 0.9, for instance, means a bouncing ball will rise to 90% of its previous height after each bounce. Write a program to input a coefficient of restitution and an initial height in meters, and report how many times a ball bounces when dropped from its initial height before traveled by the ball before this point.
