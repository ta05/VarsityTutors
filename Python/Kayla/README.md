# Kayla's Assignment

Kayla's assignment was to write the following functions

- sum: returns the sum of a list of numbers
- mean: returns the arithmetic mean of a list of numbers
- median: returns the median of a list of numbers
- stddev: returns the population standard deviation of a list of numbers

We wrote these functions from scratch and also used python's built-in functions and the statistics package which already performed what we needed.
