# Substitution Cipher

**Instructions**: Write a program to encode or decode a message using a Substitution Cipher.

## Part 1: Encryption

Create two new classes called `Encryption` and `Main`. Provide a menu to allow the user to choose between encryption and decryption. Allow the user to continue entering messages for processing until he/she decides to quit. Write a method to generate a randomized alphabet and print the new alphabet to the screen. Write a method to encrypt the plaintext message and print the result. Write the encrypted message to a text file.

## Part 2: Decryption

Write a new class called `Decryption`. Allow the user to read the encrypted message from the text. Use the cipher alphabet created in part 1 to write a method to decrypt the encrypted message and print the result.
