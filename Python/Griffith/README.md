# Car Speed

Write a program that calculates the speed of several cars. The program must ask the user to enter the distance travelled (in miles) and the time it took them to travel that distance (in hours). The program should then calculate and immediately display the speed of the car in miles per hour (speed = distance / time). From the user's perspective, the program should look something like this:  


Enter the miles driven by car 1: 100  
Enter the number of hours it took 1 to drive that distance: 2  

Car 1 traveled at 50.0 MPH  

Would you like to calculate the speed of another car (type "Yes" or "No")? yes  

Enter the miles driven by car 2: 200  
Enter the number of hours it took 2 to drive that distance: 5  

Car 2 traveled at 40.0 MPH  

Would you like to calculate the speed of another car (type "Yes" or "No")? no  

Have a nice day!
