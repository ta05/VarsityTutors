# Tasks

## Problem 1 - Distance in the Plane

Create a class named `DistanceInThePlane.java` (Include the main method)  

Import the Scanner class using `import java.util.*` or `import java.util.Scanner`. Create your scanner object inside the main method.  

Ask the user to enter the 4 points and store them as integers. Use the given *Equation* to calculate the distance between the two points and store it in a variable.  

Use the midpoint formula to calculate the midpoint of the two coordiantes

## Problem 2 - Even

Create a class called `Even.java`  

Import the Scanner class using `import java.util.*` or `import java.util.Scanner`. Create your scanner object inside the main method.  

Ask the user to enter a number. Your task is to implement a **while loop** to print all the even numbers from 0 to the entered number. **Hint: inside the while loop, you will need an if block to check whether a number is even or not.** It's possible to solve this using a for loop. But you must use a while loop. You can print the even numbers either in ascending or descending order.
