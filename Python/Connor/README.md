# Lab 2

***Problem 1*** Write the python code that prompts the user for **two integer values** and displays the result of the first number divided by the second, with exactly **three decimal places** displayed.  

***Problem 2*** Write the python code that prompts the user for **two floating-point values** and displays the result of the first number divided by the second, with exactly **five decimal places** displayed.  

***Problem 3*** Write the python code that prompts the user for **two floating-point values** and displays the result of the first number divided by the second, with exactly **six decimal places** displayed in **scientific notation**.  

***Problem 4*** Write the python code that prompts the user to enter an upper or lower case letter and displays the corresponding Unicode encoding.  

***Problem 5*** Write the python code that prompts the user for **two integer values** and displays the results when each of the following arithmetic operators are applied. For example, if the user enters the values 7 and 5, the output would be:  

`7 + 5 = 12`  
`7 - 5 = 2`  
`7 * 5 = 35`  
`7 / 5 = 1.40`  
`7 // 5 = 1`  
`7 % 5 = 2`  
`7 ** 5 = 16,807`
