# Roster

Implement a program that simulates a basketball roster. First add 5 players to the roster by assigning them a jersey number and rating.

Then print a menu that allows the user to select from the following options:

o - output roster  
a - add player  
r - remove player  
u - update rating  
c - change number  
q - quit  

## Output Roster

Prints each player's number and rating on separate lines.

## Add Player

Adds a player to the roster by asking the user to input the new player's jersey number and rating.

## Remove Player

Removes a player from the roster by asking the user for the jersey number of the player they'd like to remove.

## Update Rating

Updates a player's rating by getting the player's number from the user and the new rating.

## Change Number

Changes a player's number by requesting the player's number from the user and then asking for the new jersey number.



After an option from the menu is executed, print the menu again and ask for the user's selection. Repeat until the user opts to quit.
