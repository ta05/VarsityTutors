# Coin Flip Simulator

Write a program that simulates flipping a coin 1000 times. The program should print the 1000 flips indicating a Heads with an "H" and a Tails with a "T". Also keep track of the longest run of Heads. Then in a table, display the number of runs of length i where i is between 1 and the longest run (inclusive).

## Example
