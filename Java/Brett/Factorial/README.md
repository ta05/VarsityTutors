# Factorial

Create a class called **Factorial.java**

Import Scanner. Create an object of the Scanner class.

Create a `welcome()` function that will print a welcome statement. For example, `"Welcome to our factorial class"`.

Create an `int` type `static` function called **`public static int factorialUsingWhile(int n)`** which will have a single integer parameter.

Inside **`factorialUsingWhile`**, use a while loop for calculating the factorial. Return it.

Create a function called **`public static int factorialUsingFor(int n)`**. It also has a single integer paramerter. And inside, it uses a for loop for the same calculation then returns it.

**N.B: Don't use any print statement inside the user-defined functions. Instead use return.**

Call all three functions inside your main function. Before calling your function, you need to take an integer input using the scanner object, and use this input as a parameter in your function call.

Print outputs. Don't use `println()` or `print()`, use `printf()`.
