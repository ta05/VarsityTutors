# Project 5 Task 2

## Task

Write a program which creates a lits of randomly chosen donations to 15 different charities.  
First the program should create a list of 100 donations, choosing both a random charity (1-15) and a random donation($1.00-$100.00). You should print the charity and donation, and also record both the charity and the donation in two lists: one integer and one float.  
When you are done creating the individual donations, go back thhrough the data and create a third list, and total the donations for each charity. This list is subscripted by the charity number (1-15) and contains floating point totals. Ath the same time, create a fourth list that contains the count of the number of donations for each charity.  
Print out the total for each charity and the average average donation for each of the charities.
