# Combine Inventories

Assume you are writing a co-op fantasy game where to players each hold items, but their total inventory is combined. The first player, an elf is holding 15 arrows, 3 cures, and 72 coins. The second player, a mage, is holding 16 energy, 2 cures, and 55 coins. Write a program using a dictionary, a function and a for loop that produces the following output:  


INVENTORY
Arrows: 15
Cures: 5
Energy: 16
Coins 127
