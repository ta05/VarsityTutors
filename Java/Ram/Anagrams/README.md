# Anagrams

Your task is to write a program that:

- Allows the user to type in a word.
- Determines and displays all of the anagrams of that word (if the word was `BUG`, the anagrams would be: `BUG`, `BGU`, `GBU`, `GUB`, `UBG`, `UGB`).
- Alphabetizes the list of anagrams.
- Loads a dictionary file.
- Eliminates anagrams that are not words in the dictionary.
- Displays the alphabetized list of valid anagrams.
- Is properly commented and structured.
