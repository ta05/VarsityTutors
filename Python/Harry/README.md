# Problem 1

A point in two-dimensional space can be represented by its `x` and `y` coordinates. The distance between points, *p* and *q* can be measured by the Euclidean distance *d(p,q)*, where:

Given the set of points in the code template below, use `for-loop` to answer the following questions:

- Which point is closest to the origin (0.0,0.0)?
- Which two points are closest to each other?
