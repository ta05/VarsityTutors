# Recursion

## Split Array

Given an array of ints, is it possible to divide the ints into two groups, so that the sum of the two groups is the same.

## Split Odd 10

Given an array of ints, it is possible to divide the ints into two groups, so that the sum of one group is a multiple of 10, and the sum of the other group is odd. Every int must be in one group or the other.

## Split 53

Given an array of ints, is it possible to divide the ints into two groups, so that the sum of the two groups is the same, with these constraints: all the values that are multiple of 5 must be in one group, and all the values that are multiple of 3 (and not a multiple of 5) must be in the other.
