# Guessing Game

Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 10. Prompt the user to guess a number until they correctly guess the generated one. If the user guesses a number higher than the correct one, Tell the user that their guess was too high. If the user guesses a number lower than the correct one, tell the user that their guess was too low. Use an iterable to keep track of the previously guessed inputs from the user. If the user has already guessed a number, prompt the user to guess a different number.

After the user has guessed the correct number, display the user's number of guesses.
