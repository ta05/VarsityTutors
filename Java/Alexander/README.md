# Tasks

## Substring

Write a recursion that gets a string and two characters and returns the substring that is enclosed in two given characters. You can assume that the given string includes only one instance of each enclosing characters.  

For example, where the input string is `"This is (quite} an example"` and the first enclosing character is `"("` and the second is `"}"`, it should return `"quite"`.  

The name of the method is `getSubstring`.

## Conversion

Write a recursion that gets an int decimal value and returns the value in binary as a String.
