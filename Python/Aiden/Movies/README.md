# Movies

Store each movie with its title, genre, and Tomatometer score into a nested list.

Ex.: movies = [['Forrest Gump', 'Drama', 71],['Titanic', 'History', 89]]

Your program must:
- Ask the user if they want to narrow their results down by genre, Tomatometer score, or completely random
- if the user wants to narrow by genre, create a list holding only movies with that genre and select a movie randomly
- else if the user wants to narrow by score, ask the minimum score they wish to watch, create a list with movies that have that score or higher, and select a movie randomly
- else if they want a completely random movie, select a movie randomly

Your program must include:
- comments (add your name to the top of your program as well as comments about your code)
- nested list with your movie selections and information
- for loop(s)
- if/elif statement(s)
- random
