# Permutations

Write a program that will ask the user to enter a list of words delimited by a space. The words will be saved into a list and passed into the function `all_permutations` along with an empty list.

The `all_permutations` function will take in a list of words `word_list` and an empty list of permutations `perm_list` and will fill in and return the list of permutations as a list of each permutation of the `word_list`


## Example

Enter the list of words delimited by a space: Anthony Brian Carson  

['Anthony', 'Brian', 'Carson']  
['Anthony', 'Carson', 'Brian']  
['Brian', 'Anthony', 'Carson']  
['Brian', 'Carson', 'Anthony']  
['Carson', 'Anthony', 'Brian']  
['Carson', 'Brian', 'Anthony']
