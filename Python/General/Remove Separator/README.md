# Remove Separator

## Task

Write a program that reads a number between 10,000 and 99,999 from the user, where the user enters a comma in the input. Then print the number without a comma. Don't use `replace`, `split`, or `join`. I want you to use the string slice to solve this problem.

## Sample

~~~
Please enter an integer between 10,000 and 99,999: 23,456
23456
