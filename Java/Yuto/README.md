# Calculator

In this project, you are going to be creating a simple calculator that will only operate on positive numbers. Your program has already been set up to take in a single line of input formatted as a String, without spaces. You may assume that the inpu is guaranteed to be valid. The output should be something like "The result is ____".  

**Your result must be printed as an integer**  

Your program should be able to handle the following operators:  

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Modulo  

You may find a new String method, `contains()` to be helpful.  

`<b>contains()</b> returns: true if the char/String is found in the original String.`
