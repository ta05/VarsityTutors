# Imports

Write a function that computes the volume of a cone. Store the function in a separate file (module). The function should have two arguments: height and radius. The formula for calculating the area of a cone is: image of pi over 3 times the radius squared times the height. Test your program by asking the user to enter in the height and radius and print the function's return value. Import the function into your main program and call the function using each of these approaches:

1. `import module_name`
2. `from module_name import function_name`
3. `from module_name import function_name as f`
4. `import module_name as m`
5. `from module_name import *`
