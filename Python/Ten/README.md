# Multiples of Ten

Write a program that reads a list of integers and outputs whether the list contains all multiples of 10, no multiples of 10 or mixed values.  

Define a function named `is_list_mult10` that takes a list as a parameter and returns a boolean that represents whether the list contains all multiples of ten.  

Define a function named `is_list_no_mult10` that takes a list as a parameter and returns a boolean that represents whether the list contains no multiples of ten.  

Then, write a main program that takes an interger, representing the size of the list, followed by the list values. The first integer is not in the list.
