# Purchase

## Task

Suppose that you have been hired by a local grocery to write a simple Python program that repeatedly asks the user to type in the cost of a purchase until a value of zero is entered. The program should then display the total value of the purchase.

## Sample

Enter cost of purchase: 2.00  
Enter cost of purchase: 2  
Enter cost of purchase: .10  
Enter cost of purchase: 4.30  
Enter cost of purchase: 0.0  

Your purchase total is $8.40
